# Debater 

[Debatr.me](http://debatr.me)

Debatr is online debating platform.
People can publish links and debate over it,
one can participate either far or against.

Debates are by default 1 day long, and they will close after this duration based on which side has got more support the winner is decided and every user will be awarded D-Coins (like points) based on the number of reactions to their point of view.

You can `dare` / challenge anyone to debate against you 1-on-1 by inviting them and betting `X` D-coins. If the other person accepts the dare then at the end of that debate the winner will get back D-coin based on the `earnings` algo (not sure how it should be).   

There are different roles in the system.

- Chair : A neutral person who monitors everything. 

- Debater: A person who wants to put her/his view. 

- Spectator: A person who is watching and reacting to the debate.


Everyone gets measured. You can rate the chair, or debater, 

Winner of debate is decided by

1. Number of people participating in one side.
2. Number of +ve appreciation.
3. Reputation of the person who is commenting
4. more to come...

You can participate as spectator and support a team by giving D-coin to the team. If your team wins then you will get those points back plus as a bonus the person who has the most appreciated argument of the debate will get all D-coins of loosing side. (too much?)

Every user will have 

1. D-Coins earned

2. Dare accepted

3. Dare won vs lost

5. Badges / tags

6. Best Argument/s
